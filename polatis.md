# Polatis Class Documentation

The `Polatis` class is designed to interact with the Polatis optical switch, providing methods to apply patch lists, print patch tables, and save patch table information in a CSV format.

## Class Overview

```python
class Polatis:
    """
    A class to interface with a Polatis optical switch.
    
    Methods:
        login(): 
            Logs into the Polatis switch.
            
        apply_patch_list(patch_list): 
            Applies a list of patches to the switch.
            
        print_patch_table(patch_list, csv=False): 
            Prints or returns the patch table based on the patch list.
            
        get_patch_table_csv(patch_list, filename): 
            Saves the patch table as a CSV file.
    """
```

---

## Method: `login`

```python
def login(self):
    """
    Logs into the Polatis optical switch.

    This method handles the authentication process to access the Polatis switch.
    It should be called before any other operations are performed.

    Returns:
        None
    """
```

**Usage Example:**

```python
pol = Polatis()
pol.login()
```

---

## Method: `apply_patch_list`

```python
def apply_patch_list(self, patch_list):
    """
    Applies a list of patches to the Polatis switch.

    Args:
        patch_list (list): A list of tuples representing the patches to be applied. 
                           Each tuple should contain two strings, where the first 
                           string represents the input component and the second 
                           string represents the output component.

    Raises:
        Exception: If the patch_list argument is not a list or if it is empty.
        Exception: If some (or all) ports are not available in the patch_list.

    Returns:
        None
    """
```

**Usage Example:**

```python
patch_list = [('comp1', 'comp2'), ('comp2', 'comp3')]
pol.apply_patch_list(patch_list)
```

---

## Method: `print_patch_table`

```python
def print_patch_table(self, patch_list, csv=False):
    """
    Prints a patch table based on the given patch list.

    Args:
        patch_list (list): A list of tuples representing the patches.
            Each tuple should contain two elements: the input patch and the output patch.
        csv (bool, optional): If True, returns the patch table as a CSV string.
            Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        None or str: If csv is True, returns the patch table as a CSV string.
            Otherwise, prints the patch table and returns None.

    Raises:
        Exception: If patch_list is not a list or if it is empty.
    """
```

**Usage Example:**

```python
pol.print_patch_table(patch_list)
```

To print the patch table as a CSV string:

```python
csv_string = pol.print_patch_table(patch_list, csv=True)
```

---

## Method: `get_patch_table_csv`

```python
def get_patch_table_csv(self, patch_list, filename):
    """
    Generates a CSV file containing the patch table based on the given patch list.

    Args:
        patch_list (list): A list of patches.
        filename (str): The name of the CSV file to be generated.

    Returns:
        None
    """
```

**Usage Example:**

```python
filename = 'patch_table.csv'
pol.get_patch_table_csv(patch_list, filename)
```

---

## Usage Example

```python
from tcdona2.polatis import Polatis

# Initialize and login
pol = Polatis()
pol.login()

# Define a list of patches
patch_list = [('comp1', 'comp2'), ('comp2', 'comp3')]

# Apply the patch list to the switch
pol.apply_patch_list(patch_list)

# Print the patch table
pol.print_patch_table(patch_list)

# Save the patch table to a CSV file
pol.get_patch_table_csv(patch_list, 'patch_table.csv')
```
```
